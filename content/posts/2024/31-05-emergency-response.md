Many a times in emergency situations, we human beings do things that are
entirely opposite to what is the appropriate reaction at the time mostly due to
lack of awareness or due to the urgency of the situation. This post is a growing
list of all such situations and some of the best actions we can take
individually or as a group. I will try to get a doctor or someone who is more
knowledgeable to work on reviewing this.

Emergency responses/techniques
1. CPR
2. What to do when someone standing collapses?
3. What to do when someone is choking?
